Shell sort
•	Based on insertion sort
•	Basic idea: pre sort the input and switch to insertion sort
•	Gap is used for pre-sorting => swap distant elements
•	Shell sort starts with a large gap and gradually reduses it
•	when gap = 1, insertion sort finihes the sorting process
•	Shell sort performace depends on a concrete gap value
•	in-place algorithm: uses a small amount of extra memory (does not depend on n)
•	Unstable
